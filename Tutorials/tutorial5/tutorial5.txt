Question 1.

Decide whether each of the following sentences is valid, satisfiable, or unsatisfiable. Verify
your decisions using truth tables or logical equivalence and inference rules. For those that are
satisfiable, list all the models that satisfy them. 

a) Smoke => Smoke
The sentence is valid and satisfiable, infact it is also a tautology
Smoke => Smoke is also the same as ~Smoke v Smoke
the following truth table shows
~Smoke  Smoke   ~Smoke v Smoke
T         T            T
T         F            T
F         T            T
F         F            T
all models are satisfiable in this 

b) Smoke => Fire 
The following is satisfiable, however not valid as there is a truth assignment that does not hold
Smoke => Fire is also the same as ~Smoke v Fire
the following truth table shows
~Smoke   Fire   ~Smoke v Fire
T         T            T
T         F            T
F         T            T
F         F            F
when there is Smoke and no fire, the model does not hold

c) (Smoke => Fire) => (~Smoke => ~Fire)
The following is satisifable however not valid as there is a truth assignment that does not hold
(Smoke => Fire) => (~Smoke => ~Fire) is also the same as (Smoke ^ ~Fire) v (~Smoke v ~Fire) 
The following truth table shows
~Smoke   Fire   (Smoke ^ ~Fire)    (~Smoke v ~Fire)       (Smoke ^ ~Fire) v (~Smoke v ~Fire)
T         T            F                   T                              T

when there is Smoke and fire, the model does not hold

F      F        T            T  <===== HERE
as can be shown rule 1 entails our desired conclusion
when all rule 1 is true, our desired conclusion is also true

c)
P => Q (Rule 1)
Q => R (Rule 2)
P => R (Desired conclusion)

F     F      T          T           T         T  <===== HERE
F     F      F          T           T         T  <===== HERE
as can be shown rule 1, rule 2 entail our desired conclusion
when all rule 1 and rule 2 are both true, our desired conclusion is also true


note in all parts of this question, there was no model where both our rules were true, and our conclusion was false

Question 4.

a) (Myth => ~Mortal) ^ (~Myth => (Mortal ^ Mammal)) ^ ((~Mortal v Mammal) => Horned) ^ (Horned => Magical)

b) (~Myth v ~Mortal) ^ (Myth v (Mortal ^ Mammal)) ^ ((Mortal ^ ~Mammal) v Horned) ^ (~Horned v Magical)
   (~Myth v ~Mortal) ^ (Myth v Mortal) ^ (Myth v Mammal) ^ (Horned v Mortal) ^ (Horned v ~Mammal) ^ (~Horned v Magical)

c) proving unicorn is not horned by resolution
1. ~Myth v ~Mortal 
2. Myth v Mortal
3. Myth v Mammal
4. Horned v Mortal
5. Horned v ~Mammal
6. ~Horned v Magical
7. ~Horned                    <- INSERTED 

6. Mortal   R 7, 4
7. ~Myth    R 6, 1
8. ~Mortal  R 7, 1
9. Mammal   R 7, 3
10. Horned  R 9, 5
11. EMPTY   R 10, 7

4. it follows the unicorn is magical, as there is no resolution for magical, and infact the same proof can be done for magical
   however it does not follow that the unicorn is mythical

   the models that satisfy this KB is when Magical == T

Question 5. Vocabularies

a) Forall(x)(student(x) => studied(x, French, 2015)) where x is in the domain of student

c) Forall(x)Forall(y)((top_Score(Greek, x) ^ top_Score(French, )) => higher(x, y)) where x and y are in the domain of scores for the subject
d) forall(x)(policy(x, y) => smart(x)) where x is in the domain of people
e) ~Exists(x)(policy(x, y) ^ expensive(y)) where x is the domain of people
f) Exists(x)Forall(y)(Barber(x) ^ shaves(y, x) ^ not_shave_self(y)) where x and y are both the domain of people
g) Exists(x)Exists(a)Forall(y)Forall(z)(fool(p, x, z)) ^ (fool(p, y, a)) ^ ~Fool(p, y, z), where x and y are the domain of people, and a and z are the domain of time
